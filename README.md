# Weather App

A minimal weather app that provides current weather statistics with a clean animated icon based on the user's location. The app utilizes Geolocator for location services, Lottie Icons for animated weather icons, and the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org) for fetching real-time weather data.

## Features

- **Current Weather:** Get real-time weather conditions based on the user's current location.
- **Animated Icons:** Enjoy clean and visually appealing animated icons representing different weather conditions.

P.S: I will update this app in future with more stuffs such that it stands out from being basic to at least a better version.
